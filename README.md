### A console based piano keyboard trainer to help learn notes and basic chords.

I created this originally intending to make a ten minute flash-card style project to quiz me on chords, but after 
about eight hours of coding, I'm deciding to publish it. It's not my proudest work, but it's pretty cool.


### Features:

* MIDI support! (requires `pygame` module, install `requirements.txt`)
* Completely terminal base. If you know me - you'll understand why. I never leave the terminal. I even do my 
  adult private time browsing in ascii art (haha :D)
* Flash cards quizing on notes pointed out on a nifty ASCII keyboard
* Quizzing on fifths and full chords for all root notes

### Usage:
* Clone this repo
* `pip install pygame`
* `python3 main.py`

### Demo:
